      Welcome to the Internet home of the team Preparing Maryland for FirstNet. Under the guidance of Maryland's
      Statewide Interoperability Coordinator Ray Lehr, the Maryland InterOp Team is working to prepare our
      state for the design, deployment, and eventual operation of our Nation's first Public Safety Broadband
      Network. Explore these pages to learn more about the project, the process, and our mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) was created by Congress in 2012 to establish a nationwide
      broadband network for public safety. The final recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, the network will
      connect police officers, firefighters and EMS providers like never before. Please watch the video below
      for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mission & Vision: Provide emergency responders with the first nationwide, high-speed, wireless broadband
      network dedicated to public safety.
